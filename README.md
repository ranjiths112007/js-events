# js-events
A JavaScript events demo using HTML, CSS &amp; inline JS. Covers onload, onfocus, onblur, oninput, ondblclick, onwheel, and oncopy. Designed with a modern UI. Appreciated by my sir for the clean interface and creativity. Simple, interactive, and perfect for beginners.

# 🎯 JavaScript Events Demo Project

This project was created as part of an assignment given by my JavaScript faculty. We were asked to demonstrate different **JS Event Listeners** using basic HTML, inline JavaScript, and a touch of CSS styling.

I wanted to go a bit beyond the regular and make the UI look more modern and engaging — so I added a glassmorphism-style design with a soft gradient background.

## 🌐 What this project includes:

- **onload** – Detects when the page has fully loaded.
- **onfocus** – Shows message when input is focused.
- **onblur** – Detects when focus is lost from the input.
- **oninput** – Live display of what the user types.
- **ondblclick** – Triggers a message on double-click.
- **onwheel** – Shows feedback when user scrolls.
- **oncopy** – Detects when the user copies content.

All events are styled with a cool and minimal UI to keep it interactive and user-friendly.
